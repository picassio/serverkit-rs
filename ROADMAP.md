## Phase 23: Workflow & Automation Engine — Core (Completed)

**Priority: Critical**

Moving beyond static design to dynamic, event-driven automation. This turns ServerKit into a powerful automation hub.

- [x] **Visual Workflow Builder:** Node-based canvas with drag-and-drop nodes, connection validation, and config panels

---

## Phase 24: Customizable Sidebar & Dashboard Views (Completed)

**Priority: High**

Let users personalize what they see. Not everyone runs email servers or manages Docker — the sidebar should adapt to each user's needs.

- [x] Preset view profiles (Full, Web Hosting, Email Admin, Docker/DevOps, Minimal)
- [x] Custom view builder — toggle individual sidebar items on/off
- [x] Per-user preference storage (saved to user profile)

---

## Phase 25: Workflow Engine — Triggers & Completion (Completed)

**Priority: High**

Complete the workflow engine with proper execution logic, missing triggers, and production-grade reliability.

- [x] **DAG Execution:** Full directed acyclic graph traversal with parallel branch support (replace current linear BFS)
- [x] **Logic Node Evaluation:** If/Else condition evaluation with true/false branching

- [x] **Event Triggers:** Run workflows on system events (health check failure, high CPU/memory, git push, app stopped)
- [x] **Notification Templating:** Message placeholder substitution (`${node_id.stdout}`, `{{workflow_name}}`) in notification nodes
- [x] **Execution Timeouts:** Configurable timeout per node (1–3600s) to prevent hung workflows
- [x] **Retry on Failure:** Configurable retry count (0–5) and delay per node
- [x] **Circular Dependency Detection:** Kahn's algorithm validates graph on save and before execution
- [x] **Script Sandboxing:** Timeout enforcement, output size limits, explicit `bash -c`/`python3 -c` execution

- [x] Fleet-wide search — find which server is running a specific container, service, or port

---

## Phase 28: Agent Plugin System (Completed)
