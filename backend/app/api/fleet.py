"""
Fleet API

Cross-server endpoints that don't belong to any single server's resource
tree — primarily the target-picker support that every agent-aware
feature page consumes.

The "target" abstraction:

    target = {"kind": "local"}
            | {"kind": "agent", "server_id": "...", "server_name": "..."}

Pages render a picker; clicks send `target` in the request body of
feature CRUD calls; the backend dispatches against `target.kind`. See
`backend/app/services/fleet_targeting.py` (Phase 1) for the dispatch
helper.

This module is read-only; it does not write any state.
