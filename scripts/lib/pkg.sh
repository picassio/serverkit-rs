# scripts/lib/pkg.sh — sourceable cross-distro package-management abstraction.
#
# The ServerKit installer/updater needs to refresh the package index, install a
# handful of OS packages, and check whether something is already present — and it
# has to do this identically on Debian/Ubuntu (apt), RHEL/Rocky/Alma/Fedora
# (dnf, or yum on older boxes), openSUSE (zypper), Arch (pacman) and Alpine
# (apk). Sprinkling per-distro `if command -v apt` branches through every script
# rots fast and is impossible to unit-test, so we centralise the dispatch here.
#
# This bash helper mirrors the semantics of the Python PackageManager class in
# backend/app/utils/system.py (same detect → install/is_installed contract,
# same sudo-only-when-needed rule) so the host and the running panel agree on
# what "installed" means. It covers the three managers the Python side knows
# (apt/dnf/yum) plus the three install-time-only ones (zypper/pacman/apk) that
# the shell installer can hit before the panel is even up.
#
# Contract (these names/behaviours are depended on by callers and unit tests —
# do not rename them or add extra public functions):
#   pkg_detect                  → echoes: apt|dnf|yum|zypper|pacman|apk|"" (none)
#   pkg_refresh                 → refresh the package index (best-effort)
#   pkg_install <pkg> [pkg...]  → install packages non-interactively
#   pkg_is_installed <pkg>      → return 0 if installed, 1 otherwise
#
# Honors:
#   PKG_DRY_RUN=1          print intended commands instead of running them
#   PKG_MGR_OVERRIDE=...   force the detected manager (used by unit tests)
#
# Everything mutating is best-effort and privilege-aware: a refresh/install we
# can't run cleanly degrades to a non-zero return rather than aborting the
# caller, and sudo is prepended only when we are not already root.

# Prepend sudo for a mutating command when we are not root AND sudo exists;
# otherwise run the command as-is. Mirrors _needs_sudo() in system.py — minimal
# containers run as root without sudo installed, and Windows dev boxes have no
# sudo at all, so blindly prefixing it would break those.
