# scripts/test/stubs.sh — shared PATH-stub factories for the shell test harness.
#
# Source this from a test suite, then call the factories to materialise
# executable stubs inside a per-test bin directory that gets PATH-prepended.
# Two families live here:
#
#   * generic:   make_stub_ok / make_stub_exit — the exit-0/exit-N one-liners
#                every suite used to re-implement inline.
#   * failing:   make_stub_systemctl_exit5, make_stub_docker_fail,
#                make_stub_docker_empty, make_stub_curl_fail22,
#                make_stub_curl_ratelimited, make_stub_sleep_noop — the
#                degenerate tool behaviours a fresh or broken box presents.
#
# make_fresh_box_fixture builds the EMPTIEST valid world a fresh ServerKit
# install presents to observation/discovery functions (zero apps, zero
# containers, no optional confs, dead network, empty state) — the exact state
# that killed the 2026-07-02 production update.
#
# Keep this file bash-3-portable and shellcheck-clean: CI runs
# `shellcheck --severity=error` and `bash -n` on scripts/test/*.sh across a
# 7-distro matrix.

# files_identical <a> <b> — byte-equality that works on minimal CI images:
# EL9/Fedora containers ship without diffutils (`cmp`), so fall back to a
# checksum compare (sha256sum is coreutils, present everywhere we run).
